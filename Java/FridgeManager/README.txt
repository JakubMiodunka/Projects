Second ever and more ambitious project written in Java.

The goal is to create an app, that can be used to track the stock of products that user have currently in the fridge,
and which of them are near their expiritation date or already expired.
There will be possible to divide product to (user defined) categories to make the filtering easier.

App development is divided into 3 steps:
	1. Development of core functionalities related to interactions with database (done)
	2. Preparation of  simple GUI (ongoing - not available in this repository)
	3. Launching HTTP server that can be used as aplication web interface (to do)

The aim of the pocess is to gain some knowledge realted to:
	- Interaction with databases from Java code using JDBC
	- Basic setup of the database server (MySQL in this case)
	- Parsing documents in Java (XML)
	- HTTP servers setup and programming
	- Basics of Java Script as a part of web front-end
